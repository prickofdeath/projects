## Unit Projects
Projects  | Deadline | Description | Requirements |
--------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | 
[Unit Project 1][1-1A] |5th March 2018, Monday, 6am|Python + Pokemon Data|Students will demonstrate command of basic Python data structures, implement Python syntax for control log functions, and calculate descriptive statistics.|
[Unit Project 2] |16th March 2018, Friday, 6am|EDA + Double Datasets|Students will analyze SAT and drug use datasets & explicitly state their assumptions. They will form hypotheses and justify them with solid statistical testing in NumPy, while visualizing and interpreting their plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.|
[Unit Project 3] |6th April 2018, Friday, 6am|Regression + Housing Data|Students will review the Ames housing dataset & explicitly state their assumptions. Then they will clean, impute, and explore the dataset, justifying their modeling choices and any feature engineering. They will need to plot, visualize, and interpret their data while clearly outlining their modeling strategy in response to the prompted questions. They will also need to explain their results to a technical audience.|
[Unit Project 4] |27nd April 2018, Friday, 6am|Web Scraping + Career Data|Students will scrape and prepare their own data, then create and compare at least two models for each section: an ensemble model or decision tree, and a classifier or regression model. They will document their data and models in a notebook for technical peers, while also creating a written summary for non-technical stakeholders. |
